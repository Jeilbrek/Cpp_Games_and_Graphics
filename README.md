## What is this repository about

This is the code I wrote based on the exercises from the book [C++ Game Development By Example: Learn to build games and graphics with SFML, OpenGL, and Vulkan using C++ programming](https://www.packtpub.com/product/c-game-development-by-example/9781789535303) by Siddharth Shekar. If you want to see the original code from the book you can go to [this repository.](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/CPP-Game-Development-By-Example)

## Credits
I did not use the original audio assets. Most of the SFX were created with Bfxr, some other were downloaded from [pengameart.org](https://opengameart.org/).

The background music from the SFML proyect is composed by [Juhani Junkala.](https://opengameart.org/content/5-chiptunes-action)
